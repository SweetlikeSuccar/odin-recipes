    <p>This crockpot stuffing is an easy way to make extra stuffing for a large crowd — and it frees up stove space because it cooks in a slow cooker. This recipe is designed for use in a standard 4-quart slow cooker and is very tasty and moist!</p>

        <li>12 cups dry bread cubes</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried sage</li>
